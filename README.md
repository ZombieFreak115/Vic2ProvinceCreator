# Vic2ProvinceCreator
Creates all the files needed for provinces in Victoria 2, supports both sea and land provinces. 

What it does NOT do: 

1. Paints the map for you (you still need a imaigne editing program to fill in your province on the map)
2. Creates pops for the province if it's a land province
3. Sets positions (it creates an empty positions entry so the positions editor can read it and modify it)


Installation: Install the latest Python 3, make sure a PATH entry is created during the installation. After that, run InstallDependencies.bat in the directory the file came in, then run Vic2ProvinceCreator.py and use the UI!

Usage: Double click on the .py file and choose the mod dir you want to modify. Fill out all the required infomation, and if all goes well all relavent province data will be created based on your inputs.

If you notice any bugs or problems with the program, either DM me on discord at Zombie_Freak115#4532 or create a new issue here on github
