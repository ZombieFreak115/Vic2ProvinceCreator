# Vic2ProvinceCreator
Creates all the files needed for provinces in Victoria 2, supports both sea and land provinces. 

What it does NOT do: 

1. Paints the map for you (you still need a imaigne editing program to fill in your province on the map)
2. Creates pops for the province if it's a land province
3. Sets positions (it creates an empty positions entry so the positions editor can read it and modify it)
